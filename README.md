# Heart Disease Statlog - README

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data. By leveraging medical data, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights and identify patterns related to heart disease prediction.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of patient records categorized into two classes:

- **Heart Disease** – Patients diagnosed with heart disease.
- **No Heart Disease** – Patients without heart disease.

Each record contains multiple attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more to understand the distribution and characteristics of heart disease.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform various data preprocessing and visualization techniques, including:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and normalization.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding the distribution of medical attributes.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib & Seaborn to analyze the dataset and identify patterns.

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Alternatively, open and run Jupyter Notebook (**Heart Disease Statlog.ipynb**).

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run **Heart Disease Statlog.ipynb** to preprocess data and perform EDA.

## 📊 Project Features
- Heart Disease Data Preprocessing & Analysis
- Statistical Insights & Data Visualization
- Comparative Study on Heart Disease vs. No Heart Disease Data

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
